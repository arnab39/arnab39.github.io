I am a Machine Learning Researcher/Engineer at Apple , working on online video-language foundation models. I completed my Ph.D. in Deep Learning at McGill University and Mila – Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, under the supervision of Prof. Siamak Ravanbakhsh and Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi. My work spans both theoretical and applied deep learning research across diverse domains, including computer vision, language modeling, robotics, and AI for science. During my Ph.D., I had the opportunity to intern at Microsoft Research and Apple. I was also a Visiting Researcher at ServiceNow Research and Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab. Before moving to Montreal, I briefly worked at the Samsung Research Institute in Bangalore.

I earned my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. During my undergrad, I worked on VLSI engineering, robotics, computer vision, embedded systems, and free-form lens design. Additionally, I took a broad range of courses, covering topics from device physics to data structures and algorithm design.

When I am not working, I enjoy spending time in nature, stargazing with close friends, and engaging in deep conversations about life. I love mountains and lakes and have been on a few Himalayan treks.
