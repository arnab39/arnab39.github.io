I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Mcgill University, jointly supervised by Prof. Siamak Ravanbakhsh and Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi. I am a member of Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute and CIM - Centre for Intelligent Machines, Mcgill. My primary areas of interest include representation learning, deep reinforcement learning, equivariance, geometric deep learning, long-range sequence modeling, computer vision and generative modeling. Apart from that, I like to read more about group theory, differential geometry, tensor algebra, measure theory and general relativity. 

Before moving to Montreal, I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I have worked on VLSI engineering, Robotics, Computer Vision, Embedded systems, and Free-form Lens design during my undergrad. Other than that, I have also taken a broad set of courses ranging from Device physics to Data Structure and Algorithm design. 

When I am not working, I like to spend time in nature, stargaze with my close friends and talk about life. I love mountains and lakes and have been on a few Himalayan treks. Next on my list is Banff National Park.
