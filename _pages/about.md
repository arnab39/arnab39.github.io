I am a machine learning researcher/engineer at Apple ï£¿ working on online video-language foundation models. I did my Ph.D. in Deep Learning at Mcgill University and Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, supervised by Prof. Siamak Ravanbakhsh and Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi. My work spans both theoretical and applied deep learning research in diverse domains, including computer vision, language modeling, robotics, and AI for science. During my PhD, I had the opportunity to intern at Microsoft Research and Apple. I was also a Visiting Researcher at ServiceNow Research and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. Before moving to Montreal, I briefly worked at the Samsung Research Institute in Bangalore. 

I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. During my undergrad, I worked on VLSI engineering, Robotics, Computer Vision, Embedded systems, and Free-form Lens design. Besides that, I have also taken a broad set of courses ranging from Device physics to Data Structure and Algorithm design.

When I am not working, I like to spend time in nature, stargaze with my close friends and talk about life. I love mountains and lakes and have been on a few Himalayan treks.
