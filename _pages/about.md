I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Mcgill University, jointly supervised by Prof. Siamak Ravanbaksh and Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi. I am a member of Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute and CIM - Centre for Intelligent Machines, Mcgill. My primary areas of interest include equivariant representation learning, generative modelling and geometric deep learning. I am also interested in reinforcement learning and lifelong learning. Apart from that, I like to read more about group theory, differential geometry, tensor algebra, measure theory and general relativity. 

Before moving to Montreal, I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I have worked on VLSI engineering, Robotics, Computer Vision, Embedded systems, and Free-form Lens design during my undergrad. Other than that, I have also taken a broad set of courses ranging from Device physics to Data Structure and Algorithm design. By the end of my undergraduate studies, I was more interested in Computer Science. 

I have developed a passion for coding in the last two years. In general, I prefer to use python for my research work and C++ or java for competitive coding. Check out my Github account for code implementation of my research or papers relevant to my research. 

When I am not working, I like to spend time in nature, stargaze with my close friends and talk about life. I love mountains and lakes and have been on a few Himalayan treks. Next on my list is Banff National Park.
