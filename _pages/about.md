I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Mcgill University, jointly supervised by Prof. Siamak Ravanbaksh and Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi. I am a member of Mila - Quebec AI Institute and CIM - Centre for Intelligent Machines, Mcgill. My primary areas of interest include equivariant representation learning, generative modelling and geometric deep learning. I am also interested in reinforcement learning and lifelong learning. Apart from that, I like to read more about group theory, differential geometry, tensor algebra, measure theory and general relativity. 

Before moving to Montreal, I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I have worked on VLSI engineering, Robotics, Computer Vision, Embedded systems, and Free-form Lens design during my undergrad. Other than that, I have taken a broad set of courses ranging from Electromagnetism to Data Structure and Algorithm design. By the end of my undergraduate studies, I was more fascinated by Computer Science than Electronics. I have briefly worked at Samsung Research India as a Senior Software Engineer, which I had to quit to pursue my graduate studies. 

I have developed a passion for coding in the last two years. In general, I prefer to use python for my research work and C++ or java for competitive coding. When I am not working, I like to spend time in nature and stargaze.
