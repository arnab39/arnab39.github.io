I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Mcgill University, supervised by Prof. Siamak Ravanbakhsh and Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi. I am a member of Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute and CIM - Centre for Intelligent Machines, Mcgill. My primary areas of interest include representation learning, deep reinforcement learning, equivariance and geometric deep learning. Apart from that, I am also interested in uncertainty estimation, long-range sequence modeling, computer vision and generative modeling.

Before moving to Montreal, I did my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. During my undergrad, I worked on VLSI engineering, Robotics, Computer Vision, Embedded systems, and Free-form Lens design. Besides that, I have also taken a broad set of courses ranging from Device physics to Data Structure and Algorithm design.

When I am not working, I like to spend time in nature, stargaze with my close friends and talk about life. I love mountains and lakes and have been on a few Himalayan treks.
